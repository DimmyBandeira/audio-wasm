# Plain HTML/JS vmsg demo
A simple HTML5/JS demo that uses [vmsg](https://github.com/Kagami/vmsg) to record audio as mp3 using a modern WebAssembly version of the latest version of the LAME mp3 encoder (3.100 from october 2017). 

All the vmsg demos are React absed so I thought I'd do a plain HTML/JS one. I've taken great care to make the demo as easy to use on mobile and desktop.
